# REAL Reading Group

REAL (Reliable, Efficient, and Autonomous Learning) is a machine learning paper reading group at Northwestern University, coordinated by Prof. Kaize Ding.

## Regular Meeting

- **Time**: Every Friday, 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM CDT

## Guidelines for Presenters

1. Upload your presentation slides to this GitHub repository.
2. Share the papers you plan to present at least two days before your presentation.
3. For Research Presentations:
   - Share one or two papers that you consider exceptional.
   - The papers can be from various fields related to machine learning.
4. For Open Talks:
   - Share interesting and useful tips relevant to academic life or research.
   - You can also present any content you'd like to share with the group.
   - Topics can range from life hacks to research methodologies or any engaging subject.
